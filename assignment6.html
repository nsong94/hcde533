            Part 1: Final version of lamp
            </p>

            <p>
            As continuation of last week, I reattempted scaling the whale and making a hole for the lightbulb to fit. This time, I made the whale STL file into a polysurface first when I imported it. Before I did it, Rhino was giving me warning msgs the file is too big and my computer might crash, so I quad-remeshed a few times before running the MeshtoNURB command. After that, I was able extrude a cylinder and finally run the boolean commands I was not able to run last week. After I made the hole in the polysurface, I scaled it up for the hole.

            <p>
            As shown in the screenshot, when I exported and imported to Cura, it was going to take around 13 hours to print. From there, I decided to scale back to a simple lightbulb holder, so it only takes me around 2 hours to print.
