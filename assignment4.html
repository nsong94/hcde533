            <h1>Assignment 4: Subtractive Manufacturing</h1>

            <p>
            For this assignment, I decided to 3D print the panel pieces for the box. First, I built the puzzle pieces on Rhino. I made each edge to be 5cm, each tabs to be 10 mm to attach to the other pieces. After coming up with 2 pieces that fit together, I extruded and rendered to see if the pieces roughly fit together. I trimmed away the calculated gaps.

            <p>
            After checking the pieces fit together on Rhino, I needed to create a bottom piece. This one was a bit more complicated. I made each side 58mm to start with and trimmed away the 4 sides with the right measurements so that the box is a cube. When I was done trimming the 4 panels and bottom piece, I was ready to print.

            <p>
            I printed 5 pieces total and they each took around 30 minutes. I realized my cura setting was off and did not fill the inside, so when I went back to check what the estimation time was for filled, and it would take around 30 more minutes per panel. So I decided not to have it filled this time around.

            Here are the pictures of all the printed pieces and the final product.

            <p>
                As you can tell the pieces weren't fitting perfectly together at this point. There were still some gaps where they were supposed to fit. If I had more time, I would've have tried to reprint them, with inside filled properly so they can be fit together with more force and would hold.
