            <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

            <p>
            For my final project I'll be making a toothbrush holder. I didn't feel the need to have one since I only have one, but now that I have invisalign, I want a toothbrush holder for my toothbrush that I use to clean the aligners. I first got my inspiration for design and size reference by looking at Etsy and Amazon for reference. Here are some screenshots for the pattern design and sizing. Estimated dimension will be 100mm for the height and 35mm for the radius.
            </p>

            <p>
            In order to make this toothbrush holder, I did a quick sketch to understand what are the 4 techniques I'll be able to use. I decided to use Rhino and grasshopper for modeling, 3D print for the mold for mold (2-part), and mold design (casting) for the final product. NOTE: The exact pattern I'm using is TBD as I want to explore more. I'll also be using the 2-part mold technique again so if I want to make this again, I can use the mold.

            Here's the project timeline from 11/22 to presentation date. NOTE: I tried to build in enough time for troubleshooting in case something goes wrong.
