            <h1>Molding and casting pt 2</h1>

            <p>
            As continuation of last week, my next task is to use my molds-for-mold to create the 2 part molds. As a refresher, here's how my 3d-printed molds-for-molds turned out.
            </p>

            <p>
            When the 3d-printed molds for molds were ready, I was ready for the oomoo for the actual 2-part molds. I had the oomoo 30 already, but my Part A was completely solid so I could not use it. I went out and bought the oomoo 25 from the <a href="https://artistcraftsman.com/">Artists Craftsman supply</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            For my first try, I poured the oomoo 25 into separate cups and combined into a new cup. However, I must have poured in more Part B. It was not drying well in the molds even after around 3 hours. It was messy to fish out all the residue. I tried again and ensured I had more Part A in than last time. Doing this made the molds dry well and I was able to take out the molds out of the 3d printed molds with no issue after 75 minutes or so.

            <p>
            Then it was time to mix water with hydrostone. This part was hard to get the right amount of water and hydrostone. All 4 tries I had more water than I wanted so I ended up wasting some hydrostone. Since I had only the one 2-part mold, I had no choice but to wait for the batch to be done for my next one. My molds were small enough for me to get through all 4 casts in. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Here are some things I would do differently if I did it over again: 1) I would make more space between the mold and the highest positive point of what I'm trying to create. I ended up having to use tape to make sure the mold doesn't tear. 2) I would try to get measuring cups or a scale so I don't waste any oomoo or hydrostone.
