            Hey, my name is Nichelle Song. I'm an HCDE masters student and excited to learn the following things in this class: how to 3D print and laser cut things safely. I'll make this page look better once there's more time. Not sure what I can help with at the moment, but I'm looking to help anywhere I can. Thanks for visiting.
