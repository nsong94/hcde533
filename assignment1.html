            <h1>Assignment 1: Modelling and Laser Cutting</h1>
            <p>

            <p>
            Here's my finished and assembled kit. I'll title it "Am I Picasso?"

            For this assignment, I decided to keep it simple in creating shapes and slots as easy as possible. 

            I followed our TA's tutorial on Rhino to create the triangular shape as my first attempt.

            <p>
           I was also following his tutorial on how to render and see if the pieces fit together...I'll need practice on this, but here's my attempt. 
            </p>

            <p>
           After I have followed the steps on scaling down on the gaps and extruding, I started creating an oval shape as my unique/second shape for the assignment with the same size as my triangular shape, only to realize the size between the gaps are not matching up. So I reamde the triangle to better match the circle.

             <p>
            The slots where the pieces will attach are all 2mm.
            </p>

            <p>
          Once I was ready to try printing, I exported the file as illustrator. It took some trial and error, but I was able to export correctly thanks to some of our classmates help. My illustrator file looked like this.

            <p>
          Once it was correctly scaled, I was able to laser cut the pieces that could actually attach to each other. Although I made the slots 2mm, the pieces didn't scale correctly when I was exporting. When all was fixed, I was able to print out the 36 pieces.

          I did not plan for what the finished product would look like, so I let my creativity take over at this point.
